                <p>Specific tasks will vary depending on if youâ€™re a full-time web designer for a company or a freelance web designer who works on individual projects with clients. For example, the larger the company you work for, the more specialized the role. Whereas, the smaller the company, the more likely you are to wear multiple hats and own the design process from start to finish. And of course, as a freelancer, you can decide how to structure your web design process, the types of projects you work on, and the clients you work with.</p>

                <p>SIn compilers, the frontend translates a computer programming source code into an intermediate representation, and the backend works with the intermediate representation to produce code in a computer output language. The backend usually optimizes to produce code that runs faster. The frontend/backend distinction can separate the parser section that deals with source code and the backend that generates code and optimizes. Some designs, such as GCC, offer choices between multiple frontends (parsing different source languages).</p>

                <p>Business logic often changes. For example, the set of allowable address formats might change when an online retailer starts shipping products to a new country. Thus it is often seen as desirable to make the code that implements the business logic relatively isolated, or loosely coupled. This makes it more likely that changes to business logic will require a small set of code changes, in only one part of the code. Distant but strongly coupled code also creates more of a risk that the programmer will only make some of the .</p>
